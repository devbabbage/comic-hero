Tony grew up a genius with a brilliant mind for technology and inventions and, naturally, followed in his father’s footsteps, inheriting Stark Industries upon his parents’ untimely death. Tony designed many weapons of war for Stark Industries, far beyond what any other company was creating, while living the lifestyle of an irresponsible playboy.</p></blockquote> <figure> <img src="img/iron_man_comic_page.jpg" alt="Iron Man Comic Page"> <figcaption>An example comic page.</figcaption> </figure> </section> <section class="characteristics"><h2>Characteristics</h2><ol><li> <span class="highlight">Perseverance.</span><p> Tony doesn’t give up. He built a flying suit of armor using scrapes in a cave, he synthesized a new element when he was on the verge of death, he went head-to-head with a super soldier with nothing but a gauntlet/watch device.</p></li><li> <span class="highlight">Bravery.</span><p> This one goes somewhat with the first. Tony is one of the most base level heroes in MCU and yet he still runs head on into some of the most dangerous situations to help people. I mean, he faced down Loki without his suit.</p></li><li> <span class="highlight">Self-preservation.</span><p> I think this can be learned in a “don’t act like Tony” way. While Tony can be incredibly brave, his bravery often works against him because he takes it to the point of recklessness. He got thrown out of a window by Loki because he pushed Loki too far with his snarky comments.</p></li><li> <span class="highlight">Be your own person.</span><p> Tony was someone who could have easily coasted through life on his father’s fame and money but instead he became greater than his father. Tony is also his own person in public. He acknowledges when he has done something wrong, but he doesn’t allow others to dictate who he should be.</p></li><li> <span class="highlight">Loyalty.</span><p> Tony is always trying to protect the people he cares about. He becomes Iron Man in the memory of Yinsen, he makes sure his closest friends are secure when he is dying, all of these show how loyal Tony can be.</p></li><li> <span class="highlight">Intelligence is more important than brute strength.</span><p> Tony has about average physical strength, but his intelligence allows him to accomplish things that should, by all rights, be impossible. He is able to be on an equal playing field with people like Thor, Hulk, and Captain America because he continues to adapt and gain more knowledge.</p></li></ol> </section> <section class="friends"><h2>Friends</h2><p class="friends"> As Iron Man is a part of the Avengers - a team of superheroes -, he is really close with:</p> <img src="img/avengers.jpg" alt="The Avengers"><ul><li><a href="#">Spiderman</a></li><li><a href="#">Captain America</a></li><li><a href="#">Hulk</a></li><li><a href="#">Black Widow</a></li><li><a href="#">Thor</a></li></ul> </section> </main> <footer><p class="info">This page was created during a <a href="#">Tap Tap Kaboom class</a>. &copy; Drake Miller</p> </footer></body></html>
